# Raspberry Pi Guides

These guides are intended to help you get started with your Raspberry Pi.

## Getting Started

I recommend starting with the [First Boot guide](first-boot.md) to get some basic setup done first.

## Guides

Check out each file in this repository for more guides. Included are topics such as setting kiosk mode, rotating a touchscreen, auto-sleeping and waking your display, installing emoji, and more.
